        <item>“It’s sad when someone you know becomes someone you knew.” » Henry Rollins</item>
        <item>“She had tricked him. She had made him leave his old self behind and come into her world, and then before he was really at home in it but too late to go back, she had left him stranded there–like an astronaut wandering about on the moon. Alone.” » Katherine Paterson</item>
        <item>“Envy hurt exponentially more than heartbreak because your soul was torn in two, half soaring with happiness for another person, half mired in a well of selfpity and pain.” » Diana Peterfreund</item>
        <item>“I hate when i am laying in bed looking out my window for the moon and stars,but i can’t find the Moon.”</item>
        <item>“I know i never even had any chance with you but it still hurts seeing you with someone.”</item>
        <item>“People walk away easily but they leave their memories with us forever.”</item>
        <item>“Sometimes pain is so unmanageable that the idea of spending another day with it seems impossible. Other times pain acts as a compass to help you through the messier tunnels of growing up. But pain can only help you find happiness if you remember it.” » Adam Silvera</item>
        <item>“You know my message not my story.” Etcnepal.com</item>
        <item>“As the light begins to intensify, so does my misery, and I wonder how it is possible to hurt so much when nothing is wrong.” » Tabitha Suzuma</item>
        <item>“I am not worthy of being in love.”</item>
        <item>When sad, be really sad, sink into sadness. What else can you do? Sadness is needed. It is very relaxing, a dark night that surrounds you. Fall asleep into it. Accept it, and you will see that the moment you accept sadness, it starts becoming beautiful.</item>
        <item>Sadness is ugly because of our rejection of it; it is not ugly in itself. Once you accept it, you will see how beautiful it is, how relaxing, how calm and quiet, how silent. It has something to give that happiness can never give.</item>
        <item>Sadness gives depth. Happiness gives height. Sadness gives roots. Happiness gives branches. Happiness is like a tree going into the sky, and sadness is like the roots going down into the womb of the earth. Both are needed, and the higher a tree goes, the deeper it goes, simultaneously. The bigger the tree, the bigger will be its roots. In fact, it is always in proportion. That’s its balance.</item>
        <item>If sadness and sorrow overtake you in life, you must have taken some wrong step; when you suffer, know that you have gone astray. The suffering is only a pointer, don’t make it your life style; don’t become masochist, for masochism is a disease from which many people suffer.</item>
        <item>You cannot bring the balance. The balance that you bring is of no use. It will be forced. Balance comes spontaneously; it is already there. In fact, when you are happy, you become so excited that it is tiring. Have you watched? The heart immediately moves then into the other direction, gives you a rest. You feel it as sadness. It is giving you a rest, because you were getting too excited. It is medicinal, therapeutic. It is just as in the day you work hard and in the night you fall deeply asleep. In the morning you are fresh again. After sadness you will be fresh again, ready to be excited.</item>
